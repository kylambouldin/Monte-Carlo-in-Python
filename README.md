# Monte-Carlo-in-Python
In 9th grade (2010), I used a random number generator and the Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the irrational number Pi. 
I won 3rd place at my high school science fair.
The code in the experiment paper has been adapted for python3 and variables have been udpated

The purpose of the experiment is to approximate the value of π by using the Monte Carlo Method. The hypothesis was that if the number of points increases, then the accuracy would improve. The methods and materials used made the experiment simple. After the Pseudo- Random Number Generator is written, the experiment is complete. The data and results supported the hypothesis. According to the results as more points were thrown, the more accurate the approximation to π got.
